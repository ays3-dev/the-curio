# 🔍 The Curio | Experimental Fact-Synthesis Engine

**The Curio** is a hand-coded, high-fidelity search platform designed to bypass conventional search results in favor of obscure, rare, and “rabbit-hole” knowledge. It leverages AI (Google Gemini API) to restructure factual data into thematic clusters, encouraging deeper exploration of niche topics.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multisource Fact Synthesis:** Retrieves rare and verified facts from high-authority and niche archives including NASA, PubMed, Internet Archive, CIA Public Files, Wikipedia, and Reddit.  
- **AI-Driven Categorization:** Dynamically generates thematic "bubbles" (e.g., **Law**, **Medicine**, **History**) for every search term.  
- **Fact-Checking Integrity:** Each information card includes a direct link to the original source, eliminating AI hallucinations.  
- **Personalized User Vault:** Secure login/logout, password recovery, and full management of search history and favorites via Supabase.  
- **Advanced Image Search:** Fetches and contextualizes relevant images for every query.  
- **Seamless UI/UX:** Custom Light/Dark theme toggle with mobile-first, fully responsive design.

## 💡 How It Works

1. User enters a topic or search term.  
2. AI fetches verified facts from multiple sources.  
3. Results are categorized into dynamic thematic bubbles.  
4. Clicking a bubble opens info cards with the fact and **direct source link**.  
5. Users can save, favorite, edit, or delete past searches.  
6. Optional: Visual search returns relevant images.  

> Everything is verified with source links to maintain **full transparency**.
